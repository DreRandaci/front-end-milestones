# Client Side Development Orientation

Your introduction to the course will be spent building a strong foundation in, primarily, the JavaScript language fundamentals, and also in core CSS usage. This foundation will be slowly built upon throughout the rest of the course.

## Foundational Concepts

1. We care enough about our code that we carefully plan before we do.
1. We take raw data, and present it in useful ways for humans.
1. We encapsulate our code into modules that have a single responsibility.
1. We write tests for our code, often before the code is even written.
1. We communicate with each other, and our stakeholders to ensure we are providing value.
