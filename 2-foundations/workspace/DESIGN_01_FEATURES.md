# Features of an Application

## Defining a Feature

A feature can be defined as an atomic operation of work in an application. Let's consider a fictitious application and examine what its features might be.

You operate a hot dog cart, and want to establish an onine ordering system for business in the general vicinity of were you operate your cart. You determine that you can pay a few bike couriers to deliver hot dogs to office workers in a 3 block radius from your location. You contract a local software developer to build you a website that lets people order hot dogs, and you can keep track of sales reports over time.

What are some features that you can imagine being a part of this application?

1. Customer can order hot dogs
1. Assigning an order of hot dogs to a courier
1. Recording a sale
1. Viewing a report of sales for any given time period

These are features. They are the main ways in which people can interact with the software to help the business. They are non-technical in nature, and your product team is usually the one that defines these tickets.

## Writing Feature Tickets

For the first couple of major projects that you work on during the course, and for your capstone projects, we will be asking you to write some feature tickets. They don't need to be fancy, but they do need to describe the the work you expect the software should do, or the information it should provide.

In Github projects, you can use their Issue system to create these tickets for work. They use the term Issue as a general word that includes any work that needs to be done. You go to your repository and click on the Issues tab at the top of the screen. Then click `New Issue`.

### Markdown

Markdown is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for creating basic HTML documents with a shorthand notation for the normal HTML tags. Please read the [Github Guide for Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) practice writing Markdown.

You will use Markdown in your issue tickets.
