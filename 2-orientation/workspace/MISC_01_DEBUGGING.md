## How to read an error

In any development language you use, when a error occurs in your code, you will always be provided with what's called a [stack trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace) that will tell you what line of code was currently being evaluated, and in which file that code is located. You will be expected to read the stack trace whenever an error occurs, and investigate the exact line of code for obvious syntax errors before asking for help from staff.

Looks at the example image below. You'll see that the error shows the name of the file, and the line of code on which it occurred. I then click on the file and it highlights the code right there in the browser.
