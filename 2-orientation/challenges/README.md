# Individual Challenges

## Interactive navigation bar

Create a navigation bar out of an unordered list element, and add the following interactivity.

1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the color of the text should change.
1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the background color of the element that contains the link should change.
1. When the user clicks on one of the links, the element that contains the link should grow in size by 5px on the left and right.

## Sticky navigation bar

You will learn more about how to do this in CSS102, but if you want a challenge now, create a web page that has a navigation bar and plenty of articles so that the content goes well below the fold (fancy term for the amount of real estate that exists when the user first loads the page).

When the user scrolls now to read the rest of the content, the navigation bar should remain at the top of the page, always visible, no matter how far down the user scrolls.

# Team Challenges

## Alpha and Omega

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM - similar to the quiz and group project. You decide the height/width of the card.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be two input controls of type `color`.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be a button element labeled *Delete*.
1. When the user selects a color from the first input, then the background color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user selects a color from the second input, then the font color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.

## Chameleon Colors Containers

1. In HTML, create 3 divs
1. Give each div a background color
1. When one of the three divs is clicked do the following:
1. Give the selected/clicked div a border to indicate it has been selected
1. Reveal a form with an input box and a button
1. The user should now be able to enter a color value in the input field.
1. When the corresponding button is clicked, the currently selected div should change its background color to the color value the user entered in the input box.

## Tic Tac Toe

1. Create a grid of nine boxes
1. When any box is clicked a red `X` appears
1. When the next box is clicked a Blue `O` appears
1. #1 and #2 are repeated until a row of 3 of the same character is created
1. When a win happens:
    1. Alert the players who won
    1. Disallow any further clicks on the game board
    1. Display a `Play Again` button that resets the game
1. For a tie:
    1. Alert players that game has ended in a tie
    1. Display a `Play Again` button that resets the game
